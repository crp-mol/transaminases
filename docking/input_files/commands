# Step 1: Put the ligand (01S, 02S, 03S.... etc) into the binding site of Vf-TA. You can do it manually or by running the following YASARA macro:
yasara -txt alignLigand.mcr

# Step 2: Rosetta docking
# This command will do docking of the external aldimine intermediate into the binding site of the enzyme

# Step 3: Select the best docked structures (decoys) for MD simulations
# The best decoys are selected based on the Rosetta Interface Energy, which can be found in the enz_score.out file
