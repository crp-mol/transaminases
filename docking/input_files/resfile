## here put wanted mutations
## EXAMPLE (uncomment if you want the double mutant "W57G_F88T"):
# 57 A PIKAA G ## Mutate residue 57 from subunit A to Glycine
# 88 B PIKAA T ## Mutate residue 88 from subunit B to Threonine
# 118 A NATRO  ## Keep this residue as NaturalRotamer (don't move it)
# 150 A NATRO  ## Keep this residue as NaturalRotamer (don't move it)
